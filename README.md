I'm Jenny Gray. Been writing code for longer than most folk have been alive ;).

Experienced in C++ - mainly MFC on Windows but recently Qt on Linux too. History of back-end web development in ASP/PHP, and many other things.

Getting up to speed with modern frameworks and learning a bit of Python on the side.
